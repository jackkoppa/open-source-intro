# open-source-intro
Collection of resources to get started with open source, especially for non-programmers. Intro links for using GitHub + great first projects & communities to get involved with.

## GitHub
Guides that explain how GitHub works, and why it's important
- ["Hello World"](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) - 
No coding experience necessary. A guide from GitHub itself to create a new repository (where files are stored), add a branch (a group of changes), and complete a pull request (save the changes to the main branch). Can be done entirely online, using GitHub's easy interface
- [How to Contribute to Open Source](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/) - Detailed overview for the process of contributing to projects, including a summary of why contributing is great for both you & the code
- [What is version control?](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/what-is-version-control) - Introduction to why GitHub is necessary for open source projects, explaining how we solve the problems created by people all over the world trying to edit the same files, often at the same time


## First Projects
Great open source projects & communities that are friendly to newcomers, and have tasks that can be easily completed without code
- [OpenAQ](https://github.com/openaq/openaq-info) - Organization that collects & shares global air quality data, from 8,000+ research & government sensors. OpenAQ maintains a variety of projects, including an [API](https://github.com/openaq/openaq-api) (method for users to retrieve the specific data they're interested in), and a [public site](https://openaq.org/) that displays current & historical data. They're always looking for new people interested in air quality & open science; introduce yourself on their public [Slack](https://openaq-slackin.herokuapp.com/)

## Philosophically Open Source
Communities that follow the "aligned incentives" behind open source software, allowing users to contribute & consume shared content, for everyone's benefit
- [Stack Exchange](https://stackexchange.com/sites) - A question & answer community that started with [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/), a software-specific site that's heavily used by developers. Now, Stack Exchange has 130+ communities, dedicated to topics ranging from photography to history to "the workplace". Users are highly active, because expertise on Stack Exchange sites can be a public sign of competence
